Claw up your enemy with a dangerous dragon.You spawn a little ghost. The little ghost gives the opponent poison or also known as a curse by giving them 3-8 damage every move until the little ghost misses, which will lead the poison to stop because the ghost dies. The ghost has a 1% of missing the opponent or not working (already having poison), which makes the ghost hit almost every time when the move is first used, but you also get damaged by 1-3 HP on the first hit.
