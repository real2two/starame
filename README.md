# Starame Discord Bot
The official code for the Discord bot Starame.

Warning: The bot may still be buggy.

## Host the Discord Bot (windows)
Make sure you have node.js. You can get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/

1. Download the latest version of the Discord bot.

2. Put the Discord bot on any folder. You can make a new one.

3. Open CMD and make sure to run the command "cd" to the right folder. Then, run the CMD command "npm install discord.js". After that downloads, close the CMD.

4. Create a file called "run.bat" (well it can be anything.bat). Edit "run.bat" and make the file contain "node bot.js". After you edit the file, close the file.

5. Open the file "run.bat". It should say "Starame is ready!" soon in the console/batch program.

## What Each Folder Means
The main data files are in the folder "data\".

The folder "battles" shows the data of the battles going on (using the bot).

The folder "coins" shows the data of how much coins/gold a user has.

The folder "maxhealth" shows the data of the start HP a user has in a start of a battle. Using the command used to buy health limits the max health to 999HP.

The folder "moveid" shows the data of the moves there are.

The folder "moves" shows the data of what moves users have.
